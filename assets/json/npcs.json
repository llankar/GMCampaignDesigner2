He\u2019s delicate and wiry, with the compact musculature of a tiny aerial warrior, proportioned like a miniature acrobat rather than a fairy tale sprite.\n\nFacial Features and Expression:\nToot-Toot\u2019s pale humanoid face is animated and expressive, filled with impish glee and stubborn pride. His features are sharp but youthful, with a permanently mischievous glint in his oversized eyes that glow faintly silver in dim light. His nose is slightly upturned, and his pointed ears twitch and flutter with emotion.\n\nHair and Light:\nHis hair is a shaggy halo of pale magenta, wild and untamed, floating slightly as if moved by an invisible breeze. Around his entire body, a silvery nimbus of light glows\u2014soft yet piercing in darkness. It shifts subtly in brightness with his mood, flaring with anger or excitement.\n\nWings:\nThe most striking feature\u2014his silver, translucent dragonfly wings\u2014hum and shimmer as they beat, leaving behind the faintest trail of glittering light (ectoplasmic dust that eventually vanishes). They twitch with agitation or anticipation and carry him with dazzling agility.\n\nClothing and Gear:\nToot wears a mismatched set of pixie battle armor cobbled from discarded human items: a thimble helm, a chestplate fashioned from a beer can, a belt with a sewing needle sword, and bits of foil and old gum wrappers worked into a shimmering cloak. Every piece is oversized in pride and underwhelming in scale, reflecting his self-image as a mighty general of faerie forces.\n\nAura and Presence:\nDespite his size, Toot-Toot carries himself with regal arrogance\u2014especially around pizza. His voice is high-pitched, fast-talking, and crackling with bravado, shifting to alarm only when true threats loom.",

As his circle of friends and sources  of information shrank to include only those he agreed with, he  became even more extreme in his views and actions. He quit his  job and has gone to work for a number of political organizations  (a few of which employed methods of persuasion not quite legal  or ethical), organized rallies and fundraisers, and has even started  looking into more direct action against his perceived opponents.  Aimed in the right direction, he could be a hell of a distraction for  the PCs\u2014or their opponents.",
