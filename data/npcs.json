His voice is shaky, full of unprocessed fear.   One of the occult engineering students. The only one who returned — or escaped. He’s mentally fractured and haunted by something “still watching” from the deep. He draws maps in charcoal compulsively.",

Its tests must be survived, not fought.  Dr. Morrow forged a pact with Wyrshae — and broke it.  Milo is slowly turning into a conduit for underground ley voices.  The coal plant explosion was caused by a failed binding of the Ferruling Host.  A second expedition — funded by a corporate rival — is already underway, and hostile.  The Hollow Crown holds a vault of forbidden geologic magic — “memory ore.”  The Summer and Winter Courts abandoned this site — it belongs to no one now.  A buried letter from a 1940s miner describes Wyrshae as “our dark angel.”  Ghosts of miners trapped in 1948 can guide (or mislead) the PCs.
