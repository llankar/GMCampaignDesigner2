A  mobster who took a liking to her got her off the streets, and the  two started a pornographic website. Cali turned out to be quite  adept at this line of work: she understands the market and is able  to convince others to participate in shameful acts. Recently Cali  has discovered that there are private buyers who have more exotic  tastes, often illegal. She has begun to collect runaways off the  streets to star in these films; for many, this will be the only film  of their lives.",

He speaks \nquickly and factually with no concern for the impact of his words.\nPersonality: In love with the theory and science behind medicine, \nMitchell has a hard time with the personal interactions required \nby his profession. He has no concept of tact, and often flusters or \nupsets patients and their families with his blunt manner.\nMotivation: Mitchell just wants to do his job and eventually \nmove to a research position where he can get back to the pure \nscience of medicine and have fewer interactions with patients. \nBackground: Mitchell has always loved science, especially the \nscience of the human body. He went into nursing school early \nin life and loved it. Once he got out into practice, however, he \nfound that the perfect science and ideal situations presented in \nthe classroom were destroyed by the human element. He tries not \nto let his frustrations with patients affect his work, but even in \nideal situations he is blunt and speaks his mind without regard \nto other\u2019s feelings.

An ex-special forces  sniper, in the war he slipped up, got captured, and was held for 22  months under terrible conditions. After he escaped, he returned  home a beaten and broken man, didn\u2019t reenlist, and slowly rebuilt  his life as a private contractor.

After a stint  in the Air Force, he sold insurance, then used cars, was an office  manager for a dentist, and helped with an alderman\u2019s campaign.  He knew he was good at communicating and dealing with  people, so he became a newspaper reporter. Now he spends his  days talking to people and telling their stories, though his current  beat is on the activities, personalities, and government business  of City Hall.
